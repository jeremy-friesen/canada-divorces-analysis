2,"Northwest Territories and Nunavut are combined to calculate the rates in this table because marriage and divorce data are not available for these territories separately for the 30 and 50 year periods required for the calculation of the total divorce rates."
3,"Marriage data for the years 2004 were not available for the preparation of this table. Therefore, the average of the annual number of marriages for the years 2001 to 2003 was used in the calculation of the divorce rate for the 2004 marriage years."
